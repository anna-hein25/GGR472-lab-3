City of Boston and Cambridgeâ€™s Blue Bike stations and bike paths. 

This web page contains a source layer displaying Blue Bike stations in and around the City of Boston, as points, overlayed on top of the style layer outlining bike paths in the City of Boston and the City of Cambridge. The user is able to click each point and the Blue Bike stations name will appear, as well as the number of docks there are at that station.

User interaction features and changes in visualization include points changing the size of the Blue Bike station points based on zoom level of the map, a search bar limited to locations in the U.S., and a popup block that provides the Blue Bike station name and number of docks at the station when the user clicks the point.
